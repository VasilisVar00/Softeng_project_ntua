# Software Engineering Semester Project

This repository hosts the semester project in the course of Software Engineering (7th semester, ECE - NTUA). The topic of the project was to build a web application that enables tolls interoperability as far as the e-pass tag is concerned.Our web app provides the user with statistical data about the stations graphically represented(using charts.js) and monthly settlement calculations between two operators. The project also includes the development of CLI that enables administrative operations. Functionality of the app is demonstrated through extensive testing using Postman.Objective of this project was to provide the student hands-on experience with  different technologies and with the stages and lifecycle of a software engineering project.
